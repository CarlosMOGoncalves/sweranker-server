This is a REST webservice, developed in JakartaEE/MicroProfile, whose purpose is:
* store and manipulate different School's Software Engineering curricula
* match them with different Bodies of Knowledge
* rank them against these Bodies of Knowledge

With this in mind, the goals are:
* to compare different degrees on common ground
* to identify possible gaps or flaws on different curricula against the Body of Knowledge they should represent
* to help improve the overall quality of those degrees
